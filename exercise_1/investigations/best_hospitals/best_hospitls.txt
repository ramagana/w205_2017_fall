WHICH PROVIDERS ARE THE MODEL FOR HIGH-QUALITY CARE?

Below is a table is showing the top 10 ranked hospitals ordered by average_score.  average_score is a composite score
of all the features averaging across a normalized corrected score for each provider for each numeric procedure metrics.
It is normalize as it is divided by the maximum amount forcing each value per provider metric to be between 0 and 1.  
Moreover, it is corrected as it is not ideal for all metrics to have high scores, e.g. Mortality rate after surgery, 
as such those measures that have an ideal low number are normalized by min(score for measure_id)/(score measure_id per provider)
and if the high score is ideal it is normalized by (score measure_id per provider)/max(score for measure_id)
