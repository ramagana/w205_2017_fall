WHICH STATES ARE THE MODEL FOR HIGH-QUALITY CARE?

Below is a table is showing the top 10 ranked states aggregated from the provider level and  ordered by average_score. 
 average_score is a composite score of all the features averaging across a normalized corrected score for each provider
 for each numeric procedure metrics. It is normalize as it is divided by the maximum amount forcing each value
 per provider metric to be between 0 and 1. Moreover, it is corrected as it is not ideal for all metrics to have high
 scores, e.g. Mortality rate after surgery, as such those measures that have an ideal low number are normalized by
 min(score for measure_id)/(score measure_id per provider) and if the high score is ideal it is normalized by
 (score measure_id per provider)/max(score for measure_id)

State	average_score

OH	0.4618585016889029
ME	0.46182355670733405

Given that the above is an average across all data available for each provider across the different effective care and
readmission procedures.  We can conclude that these states on average are the 10 best models for quality care.
