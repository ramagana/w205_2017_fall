ARE THE AVERAGE SCORES FOR HOSPITAL QUALITY OR PROCEDURAL VARIABLITY CORRELATED WITH PATIENT SURVEY RESPONSES?

Correlation between average quality-care scores: 	0.32419394743840807
Correlation between average procedural variabiliy:	-0.13605034488582465

To calculation the above correlations I used the overall_rating_of_hospital_performance_rate as a measure to test correlational 
from the patient survey results for each provider.   As in the first question the quality-care scores are grouped by proveder, and 
as in the third question procedural is grouped at the procedural measure level.  In any case, niether is strongly correlated with 
the overall_rating_of_hospital_performance_rate from the patient survey.  However, it should be noted that it is not intuitive to 
looke for correlation get between the procedural variability which is at the procedure level and the survey responses that are averages 
at the provider level.
