WHICH PROCEDURES HAVE THE GREATEST VARIABILITY BETWEEN HOSPITALS?

Continuing to untilize the corrected normalized score we see the the variability is using the population variance of hospitals 
group by the measure_id level.

1. Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older who had cataract surgery and had improvement in visual function achieved within 90 days following the cataract surgery	
OP_31	0.08793309090909084

2. Appropriate Follow-Up Interval for Normal Colonoscopy in Average Risk Patients	
OP_29	0.059716748958700036

3. Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival	
OP_2	0.05262754738224803

4. Colonoscopy Interval for Patients with a History of Adenomatous Polyps - Avoidance of Inappropriate Use	
OP_30	0.03702097913377034

5. Head CT or MRI Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 minutes of ED Arrival	
OP_23	0.03667518183813363

6. Thrombolytic Therapy	
STK_4	0.026088609423138766

7. Median Time to Fibrinolysis	
OP_1	0.021769124643404247

8. Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate	
OP_3b	0.019020847437320413

9. Influenza Immunization	
IMM_2	0.01731640927714904

10 .Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin Therapy Discharge Instructions	
VTE_5	0.014841473421776245

The above at the most varying and as we see the variance drops off fairly quickly as there are relatively few measures.
